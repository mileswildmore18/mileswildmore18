## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Miles Wildmore. I am a web developer with background of designing in the front end side, and learning the back end side. My expertise and knowledge are in designing the webpage to look as pretty as possible and creating wireframes for the projects I am involved with. I look forward to more projects in the future based on animation on websites to bring life and visual appeal to everyone who visits them.

# My Experiences:

## HTML, CSS, POSTGRES, REACT, Express, Node, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Three.js

# Current Projects

Working for Cloud Nexus IT Solutions to build their website from the ground, and gaining more experience through Bootstrap.
Also Working on my updated Portfolio for jobs out there.
